Other prospectors, some or all of whom had previously seen tracks, were Roy Smith, Gabe Lefever and John Peterson. All would be dead now, and it appears that only Marion Smith, at the time, and Fred Beck, in later years, are on record as having told the story. Marion Smith's gun was a Remington automatic rifle, and Beck's a 30-30 Winchester. Beck said both of them were dead shots and was sure that all shots hit. Probably for this reason he believed, in his later years at least, that the apes were not normal physical beings. Beck's accounts of the incident, more than 40 years later, have major inconsistencies. He told Roger Patterson, on tape, that Marion Smith did all the shooting on the first day. In his booklet he gives the account used here, with both of them firing. This incident was not the origin of the belief in hairy apes at Mount St. Helens, there had been talk of them since th late 1800's.","naked eye","prospecting","Y","upright","Y",,"100 yards","200 yards","25 feet",,"shot",,,,"2","several","31 to 40","R",,"Wash"
