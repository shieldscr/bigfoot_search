Near the bottom of the valley the snow ran out. He returned early the next morning to look for more tracks and instead, about a half mile away in a logged-off area 200 feet from the road saw two creatures asleep in the snow near a swampy creek. He settled down to watch with binoculars from 100 yards away. They slept with their backs to the sky, their limbs drawn in under them, heads on hands. One rolled on its side, then returned to original position. Some trees were nearby but they had not bothered with shelter. When they woke up they moved into the creek and started eating water weeds. Both were females. One appeared swollen the the genital region, and every 15 minutes or so would run its hand through this area for a couple of minutes. It made a wailing noise which he thought was a call. It also stepped up on a two-foot stump in the creekbed, bent forward 45 degrees, knees slightly bent, and defacated in the water, then wiped itself with its hand and licked the hand briefly.

Left and right impressions were widely separated, and there was a wide but shallow drag mark between them, with small but deeper drag marks on the outside of the the footprints. Tracks and drag mark led to a small lake and out onto the ice, where a large hole had been made by lifting out broken slabs of ice. There were footprints but no drag mark leading away. The men started around the lake, then noticed across the water from them a creature standing under a tree watching them. The sat down and had lunch, while it stayed there, arms hanging, motionless except for a slight swaying. One of the prospectos drew a sketch of the creature as they watched it, and the made comparisons with the trees to try to determine its height, estimates ranging from 10 to 15 feet. They went on their way, but returned later in the day. The creature was gone and there were more tracks. They also saw older, smaller tracks on a nearby plateau, leading to a hole five feet across in the ice on a pothole. Several days later one of the prospectors returned in a helicopter with a newspaper reporter. From the helicopter they saw a fresh set of big tracks on a ridge, but could not land.

The story is far too long and complex to summarize, or to represent coherently with computer answers. Ostman portrays a much more humanlike lifestyle for the sasquatch than is indicated in other reports. For instance, they lived in one place as a family group, with the mother bringing in food for all, and with a sleeping place apparently equipped with crude blankets. The story would be unacceptable if told at a later time, but is included because of the physical descriptions of the individuals, which have stood the test of time, and of cross-examination by experts in ape anatomy, but were quite different from the public image of the sasquatch in 1957 when he first wrote the story out. This was 33 years after the date of the event. Two incident reports are used here, one to describe the place where he was picked up, the other where he saw the sasquatches. Superhuman action by this individual included carrying Ostman and his sleeping bag over one shoulder, his packsack over the other, and going over more than one mountain ridge in part of one night.","JWG","summer","Albert Ostman intv. by John Green.

It followed, wading the river but did not come to his house for about 20 minutes, when it pushed against the wall hard enough to damage the old house, prowling and grunting. Then it went away. Huge tracks were found the next day. This informant tells of seeing the same sasquatch the following winter, when it again chased him without catching up.

There were also people who were told about it by parents who were there at the time or shortly after. On the other hand, the newspapers at New Westminster at the time dismissed it as a hoax. The story was that the crew of a train saw someone lying beside the track. When they stopped the train the supposed man sprang up with a sharp, quick bark and began to climb the bluff beside the track. It became trapped on a shelf and one of the men got above it and knocked it out by dropping a rock on it. The creature was then tied up and lowered, and taken to Yale, where the train was headed. It is described as \"something of the gorilla type standing four feet seven inches in height and weighing 127 pounds.\" It was covered with inch-long, glossy hair, and was stronger than a man. A George Tilbury, of Yale, looked after the creature and proposed to take it to England for exhibition. Note that at 127 lbs. a creature only 4'7\" high would be of very heavy build.

The newspaper stories so far found do not tell of his experience at the time that it took place, but in connection with later sightings on Vancouver Island. One story says it happened three or four years before (ie 1900 or 1901) another quotes King as saying it was \"a little over a year ago\" The early versions, printed at a time when King was out of the country, say that he was timber cruising alone \"inland from the head of Campbell River\" in an area where Indians refused to go, and that one evening he surprised a creature bending over a little water hole washing edible grass roots, which were in two neat piles, uncleaned and cleaned. At King's approach the creature uttered a very human cry of terror and defiance, ran up the hillside half way and then stood watching him. When he approached it dashed away through the underbrush. He heard its cries all that night. The body was covered with reddish-brown hair, the arms were peculiarly long and used freely in climbing and brush running. The trail showed a distinct human foot, but with phenomenally long and spreading toes. The later story, after his return, quotes him as saying he approached to about 25 feet before the creature saw him, that it was squatting by a little stream washing a kind of wild onion, that it stood up over six feet high, and that it was covered all over with long, coarse black hair, which on some portions of the body was a foot long.

Estimated weight at 240 pounds. Glared a moment, uttered a cry, a half human sort of grunt, grasped a branch and hoisted itself up the bank of the creek, then ran away through the underbrush, slightly bending as it did so, with the speed of a startled deer.

Ron said that as Don was sitting by the fire he rose and fell forward as if lifted from behind, and Ron saw a creature on the other side of the log behind Don, just about 15 feet from Ron, with red, red eyes and a well-defined shape, arms seemed matted with dirty brown fur, legs and shoulders huge, arms long.

They separated and Meissner heard branches breaking then found himself face to face with a sasquatch 56 feet away (measured later). Sentinel story says he fired in panic and the creature dropped to one knee then ran into the bush. Advocate story quotes his father, Ken Meissner, as saying that the animal fell, Tim went to get his friends, but when they returned it was gone. Ken Meissner also said that he had investigated at the scene and found clear tracks, human in shape, 16 inches long and 9 inches wide, sinking in soft soil more than an inch. He made casts, measured the stride at 5 feet. Tim Meissner said the creature was about nine feet tall and weighed about 400 pounds. It was covered with long, curly dark brown hair, except for a bare chest, had a squarish face, looking more human than ape, glared at him with huge, shining eyes, and stank like a rotten garbage dump. Another Sentinel story, also May 4, quotes Rene Dahinden making comments that indicated Meissner had said he could see neither female breasts nor a penis. The Advocate quotes Ken Meissner as saying that Tim estimated the animal to weigh 900 pounds, and that its shoulders were four feet wide. Calgary Herald story May 11 quotes Jack Wood, a teacher, as having gone to the site and found a footprint 16 inches by 9 inches with a 6-inch heel, on the side of a mountain trail. He said it had five toes and no claw marks. One toe was much smaller than the others. The Sentinel printed a picture of this cast. This story quotes Tim as saying the creature stood silently watching him from the trees until he fired at its head, and that it went down on one knee and one hand, then got up and ran away.","JWG","spring","Kamloops Sentinel, May 4, 1979, quoting Tim Meissn",,"semi collapse;fled",,,"3",,,"Y","1","5126--","120073-",,,,"M",,,,

Going down to the creek Joe, in the lead, saw on the far slope among the trees a large furry animal, not a bear. He later said he thought it had to be a burnt stump, but on a second look it was gone. He did not mention it until after fresh 13-inch tracks were found in forest litter and dirt at the top of a bank a short time later. Bruce than found a print in moss that was 18 inches long.

Myles Jack noticed someone kneeling in the snow near the trees. It took off immediatedly. Looked like a man but 7 to 8 feet tall. It was around for about an hour, but would run whenever anyone was looking at it. He told the Vancouver Province (March 18, 1987) that it was black and had heavy-set legs. He called to Bryan Mesdagh, who saw saw it standing in a corner of the clearing. It darted back in the brush. B.C. Report magazine, April 6, 1987, quotes Mesdagh as saying he saw enough to know it wasn't a bear. A Southam News report names Danny Crowe as a third witness, who glimpsed the creature in their truck's headlights. There was a fourth witness, nowhere named. That night and the next day men studied and tried to follow trails of huge footprints in powder snow two feet deep. They indicated that the creature had circled the clearing all around and kneeled down a coouple of times, once only 10 feet from the truck. They could not spend much time tracking, and their own tracks soon messed up the situation. Other people also saw the tracks, including a reporter and photographer from the Province, who learned of the incident as a result of someone overhearing the witnesses talking about. The men made no attempt to report what happened or to obtain publicity. Bob Titmus and John Green went to the site, but too late to learn anything from the tracks. Anne Rees, Province reporter, said the tracks were about 15 inches long, and six feet apart. Where it knelt the knees were far apart, the feet together. Knees were three feet apart and leg impressions a foot wide. Nobody could duplicate the stride or the impressions in the ground. She was there two days after the incident. Bob Zieglgansberger, site manager for the well owners, Canadian Hunter, said he had found where the tracks had crossed the road a mile from the campsite and followed them 400 yards into the bush. He said the stride was about 4 1/2 feet on level ground. He is 6'2\" and had to jump to match them. They stepped right over a snowbank beside the road 3 feet high and 4 feet wide and he could not match that. He could not find where the tracks started from, only where they left the road. (Green and Titmus could find neither.) Mesdagh said sometimes the tracks would head into the bush and then just stop, no more tracks. He never did find a trail he could follow any distance.","JWG","spring","John Green intv.

Unheard, he came within about 50 feet of three animals on a rockpile topping a ridge slightly above him. A large male and a female were squatted down picking up rocks, smelling them and putting them down in stacks. They moved about 50 feet in 15 minutes doing this, then the male dug down into the rockpile, making the jagged rocks fly, some of them over 100 pounds. He brought out a grass nest from which all three dug out hibernating rodents, six or eight in all, and ate them as a human would eat a banana, cramming them in in a few bites. They then seemed to realize he was there, stood up and dashed \"faster than a horse\" around the hill and out of sight behind tree limbs. The mother carried the baby in front of her. The baby had to dig out his own rodent, and it kept on the side of its mother away from the male, so he doubted if they were a family. The male was over six feet tall, dirty brown, with much longer hair on his head, shoulder and neck, hanging down in strings. He was very wide at the waist and got wider from there up. When squatted down they had to bend forward to pick up rocks, their arms were not long enough to reach. Thumbs were apparently lower down on the wrist than humans', they did not use them in grasping rocks. The female was smaller, and fawn coloured. Her breasts were lower on her chest than a human's. All were very heavily built, but the female was not as heavily muscled as the male and her features were less coarse. The young one was much smaller. The next day Thomas looked for tracks but found only a couple of partial imprints that he could not connect with the creatures he had seen. The hole dug in the rocks was five feet deep and almost as steep-sided as a well. It is still there, and it seems questionable whether humans could make it, even with mechanical assistance. Jim Hewkin, a retired wildlife biologist, has since found several similar holes in deposits of loose rock in the general area, all of them, to judge by moss and weathering, older than the Thomas hole.","JWG","fall","Glen Thomas intv. by John Green.

The tracks indicated the creatures were spending the day in the heavy brush but coming out each night to pull up bunches of long grass, eating the lower part of the stems. The two individuals were always at least 100 feet apart. Twice the larger one caught a rabbit, pursuing it for only about three 10-foot paces. Stomach and hair were left uneaten, but bones were gone. The tracks often crossed a creek. Glen did not follow them into the deep bush for several days. When he did he found where the larger one had bedded down under a big cedar.

Two days later he found the tracks again, going North, and followed tlhem over a hill and down to a level where there was no snow. They were travelling 200 to 300 feet apart. In deep snow they sank 18 inches where he could jump on the snow without making a mark. The tracks indicated that the toes of both individuals pointed down. The larger one also had a scar on its left instep.","JWG","winter","Glen Thomas intv. by John Green","contact",,"1st person",,"2","Y","10-foot running strides in snow",,"2","4507--","12225--",,,,,,,,

He had a fleeting glimpse in the headlights of a grey orangutan-type creature that quickly stepped off the road. Then his car seemed to skid and he had a glimpse in the rear-view mirror of an animal-human face illuminated by the taillights. A quarter mile down the road he stopped to try to pull aside a small tree down across the road. Then he heard feet pounding, and a hair-covered creature a bit larger than himself ran up to him and commenced circling around him. It would move away but whenever he moved back towards his idling car it rushed him. He thought it was getting increasingly angry, but eventually it got far enough off that he was able to rush back to the car, get in and smash the tree out of the way. He felt that something was trying to hold the car back, but it broke loose. The thing made a roaring, panting noise. He kept going and the memory blocked out before he reached Orleans.

This report was widely publicized and attracted half a dozen sasquatch investigators, who in turn stirred up a dozen more reports in the area in the next few months.

Next day they found 4-toed tracks, very broad at the front but tapering to a pointed heel. Many trees were stripped of fruit far higher than a man could reach. There were further sightings and track finds. Several sasquatch hunters investigated, including Ken Coon, and so did members of the sheriff's department, including Sgt. Huse. One sighting made by the entire Baddour family involved three creatures presumed to be parents and a child, seen at night near the house. At least one cast made of a large print. Once the Baddour daughter saw one of the creatures in the early morning as she boarded a school bus at Alpine Boulevard, a quarter mile or more from the house. Coon and associates talked to nearby ranchers who spoke of \"monsters\" frightening their livestock and occasionally carrying off great numbers of chickens or ducks, leaving 4-toed prints. A rancher showed Coon's group one print in dust, 14\" by 10\", V-shape, 4 toes. Baddour said the creatures were not known apes, but more ape than human.

At about 25 yards it threw in his direction a 5 1/2 lb. rock it apparently had in its hand. He went back to camp and the creature retreated up a ravine. Later Sharon saw it approach to about 30 feet as she sat in the car. Around the fire that night they saw dark forms in the trees above the camp and \"at least four different sets of eyes glowing red in the darkness.\" Later, Sharon, sleeping in the car, was awakened about 4.30 a.m. by loud footfalls and saw a dark form standing a foot from the car. It reached across the hood and flipped the radio antenna on which Ben's shirt was hanging, then walked away. Next morning 9 good tracks were found on the hill above camp and across the ravine, as well as many possible tracks in forest litter. Four casts were made. That evening (August 12) about 8.30, Sharon saw eyes up the skidroad and Ben walked over and saw a sasquatch about 75 feet away. It gestured, moving its right hand from its hip outward, and he copied the gesture. It crouched low, he followed suit. After several exchanges of gestures it turned and walked away. About 9 p.m. Archie and Bill Buckley and George Haas arrived, but the creatures were seen no more. Several others joined the party later, and J. Foster, Ben's uncle, on August 15 found a small fawn on the hillside 200 yards east from camp which appeared to have been torn in two.

They were Marion Smith, his son Roy, his son-in-law Fred Beck, Gabe Lefever and John Peterson. They had occasionally seen large barefoot prints by creek beds and springs while prospecting in the Mount St. Helens area, the largest 19 inches long. Prior to the first sighting they had been hearing shrill whistles in the evening for about a week, with answering whistles from ridge to ridge. On July 10 Marion Smith and Fred Beck went to a spring for water and Smith spotted an ape about 100 yards away on the other side of a little canyon, standing by a pine tree. It dodged behind the tree and poked its head out. Smith fired three times, grazing the bark. The creature ran off down the canyon, seen again 200 yards away, where Beck fired at it three times. That night the cabin was attacked from outside. It had no windows, so the attackers were not seen. Many rocks were apparenty thrown at the cabin during the night, some coming down the chimney into the fireplace. At the start a wooden strip used for chinking was knocked out. At one point a hairy arm reached through the gap left between the logs and grabbed an axe, but the head jammed and Smith shot along the handle. The axe was retrieved. The following morning the men planned to get out, leaving all their supplies and equipment. Beck saw an ape standing about 80 yards away near the edge of the canyon and shot at it three times. It fell into the gorge, about 400 feet down. At the Spirit Lake ranger station Marion Smith told the story to the ranger, and at home in Kelso he told some friends. Many people went to the site, and large four-toed prints were found. (Two incident entries, for July 10 and July 11.)","JWG","summer","Fred Beck intv. by Dick Grover.

About 200 yards from the house it was joined by another, a head shorter. The large one picked up a dark object about the size of a bale of hay, but with loose ends that flapped in the breeze. It handed this to the smaller creature, which carried it. The big one then walked straight toward the house, coming within about 100 feet before Bob, who was becoming concerned, went to wake his father. When they returned both were gone. The sheriff's office was notified at 6.30 a.m., and in a 50-minute search Deputy M. H. McFerrin and Lea could find nothing. Later that day, however, Bob's sister Debbie found three tracks in the pasture, and the day after that Bob made a cast of one of them, 17.5 inches long, 7 inches wide, width almost uniform throughout length, and with only three large toes, the centre one the longest. In his written statement Bob described the larger creature as 10 to 11 feet tall, head large in proportion, all muscles big and bulky, shoulders round. He told Wolverton that it took long strides with arms swinging, appeared to have no neck, was covered with dark brown to black short hair except on the face, which he could not describe. Forehead protruded outward to a rounded head, nose was pushed in, didn't notice ears. Walk was very smooth, no stooping, legs did not bend much at the knees, back came straight down below buttocks, no inward curve at the waist. Wolverton found Bob's story convincing. However he told Wolverton the thing was 8 feet tall and he didn't like being misquoted about the height (10 feet) in the Helena paper. In his own written roport he put 10 to 11 feet both in the document and on a drawing. No reference to the amount of light or to where the creatures appeared from","JWG","spring","Capt.

He took a shot at it as it crossed the road, upright, and bounded into the timber above the road. Estimated 10 to 12 feet tall, described as both \"husky as a bear\" and \"very slim\".

In Gunnison National Forest south of Hwy 50 between Doyleville and Sargents. Early in the morning the 54-year-old riding an ATV came upon fresh tracks crossing a snow drift, hunanlike in shape but 18 inches long and with depth indicating great weight. As he examined the tracks five bull elk burst out of the timber in apparent panic and as they rushed past he killed one with an arrow. After gutting it he used the ATV to pull it high in a tree, hind feet 10 feet off the ground, and went for help in bringing it in. Less than three hours later the hunters found the carcase twisted in half, the head, shoulders and forelegs still in the tree, the rest gone. The same tracks were all around, as well as similar 13-inch tracks. That evening they reported the incident to a wildlife officer, who blamed bears and declined to investigate. That night about midnight loud howls and grunts from two different directions, close by, awakened the hunters. Next day the two men from Arkansas were late returning to camp. They said they had gone back and followed the tracks toward the timber line, and about 8 a.m. saw two manlike creatures moving across a snow field. They shot the smaller one with three arrows at about 100 yards. It fled at high speed up the steep slope, apparently unhindered by the arrows, and disappeared over a saddle. The larger creature roared and started for the hunters, squealing loudly. They fled and the creature followed but did not try to catch them. Instead it kept between them and their camp until they finally abandoned their equipment and reached the highway by a circuitous route. The men went to Gunnison and reported the incident to forest service personnel, who blamed bears. Two returned next day with rifles and found only one destroyed bow and backpack. Wilson writes that he talked to three of the hunters, and saw photos of the remains of the elk, and of the tracks, which were clearly not bear tracks, but typical sasquatch tracks. He paid for copies of the photos, but it is not clear if he got them. Wilson believes the story. See also 1001411.","JWG","fall","BFRO W.P.
